# Factory Pattern
The Factory Pattern, like it's namesake, produces a 'product'. An object may know that it needs to create a object, but that object doesn't know which specific subclass should be used. This is where a Factory comes in. A Factory Pattern creates a new object based on different factors, such as application settings / configuration, the state of the application, or future expansion of the codebase.
